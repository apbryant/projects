The question I want to answer: can machine learning discern between native and non-native English speakers?
I created a dataset of fifty instances of correspondence between friends, colleagues, bosses, and acquaintances. I got messages from email, WhatsApp, Messenger, LinkedIn, and Internations.

The first column is message text. The second column indicates whether
the message came from a non-native or native speaker with a zero and one respectively.

I removed apostrophes from contracted words to help with processing but
otherwise left any language errors as-is.

The native speakers mostly come from the United States,
and the non-native speakers mostly come from Chile and speak Spanish as a first language. The non-native speakers had pre-intermediate to advanced levels of English, meaning that the people in my sample could all have a simple conversation in English, albeit with some pronunciation and grammatial errors.

Using my data, the model produced an accuracy of .7, a precision of .83 and recall of .71.

Further questions I have are how the results would change on a larger dataset, and with data of people from other countries.
